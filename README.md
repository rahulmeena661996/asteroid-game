We created the classic computer game ‘Asteroids’ using Altera De0 Nano FPGA board. Asteroids is a game set in 2 dimensions featuring a spaceship in a field of moving asteroids. The player controls the spaceship, moving it around the playing field and shooting at the asteroids to destroy them. When hit by the spaceship’s weapon the asteroids are removed from the field.
